<span style='font-size:23'>Thank you for taking part in this eye-tracking study. Your participation is extremely valued, and will help us to better understand how we process facial expressions.<br>
This study consists of three parts. In the first part, you will see photographs of facial expressions and we will use the webcam to track your attention. Your video will not be saved; instead, the location where you look will be saved anonymously. In the second part, you will see some photographs and you will have to guess the emotion expressed in the photographs. Finally, in the third part, you will complete some questionnaires, such as rating some statements that best describe you and how you feel, and providing your demographic information.</span>

0,,user,"<span style='font-size:20'>Please choose a quiet and well-lit place to take part in the study so you can concentrate, as the quality of the data is very important to us. <br /><br>
<span style='font-size:20'>In this first part, you will see photographs of facial expressions and we will use the webcam to track your attention. Your video will not be saved; instead, the location where you look will be saved anonymously.  We will go through some practice trials to familarise the procedure.
<br>
<br>After the calibration, please keep your head and body as still as possible, this is to ensure we have captured your attention accurately. When there is a cross on the screen please look at the centre of the cross.<br>

<span style='font-size:20'>Please note that you will be given opportunities to have breaks, please only take breaks when the instruction shows on the screen, as any interruption of the study will require calibration for attention tracking.
<br>
<br>
Now we will start a short practice (there is no calibration dot for practice).
