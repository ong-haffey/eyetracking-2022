<span style='font-size:23'>Thank you for taking part in this eye-tracking emotion study. Your participation is extremely valued, and will help us to better understand how we process facial expressions.<br>
<br>
This study consists of three parts. In the first part, you will see images of people expressing emotions. We will use the webcam to track your attention. Your video itself will not be saved. The location where you look will be saved anonymously. In the second part, you will see images of people expressing emotions and you'll have to judge which emotion they are expressing. Then finally, in the third part, we will ask you for some basic demographic details and to rate some statements that best describe you and how you feel.<br>
<br>
It is important that you use a laptop (as opposed to a desktop or a tablet) for this study.</span><br>
<br>
This study, conducted by Dr Anthony Haffey and Dr Jia Hoong Ong from the School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, has been reviewed by the School Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct. <br>
<br>
If you have any questions or wish to withdraw from the study, please contact us at: a.haffey@reading.ac.uk<br>

<span style='font-size:20'>Please choose a quiet and well-lit place to take part in the study so you can concentrate, as the quality of the data is very important to us. <br /><br>
<span style='font-size:20'>In this part, you will see images of people expressing emotions. We will go through some practice trials to familarise the procedure.
<br>
<br>After the calibration, please keep your head and body as still as possible, this is to ensure we have captured your attention accurately. When there is a cross on the screen please look at the centre of the cross.<br>
<br>
<span style='font-size:20'>Please note that you will be given opportunities to have breaks, please only take breaks when the instruction shows on the screen, as any interruption of the study will require calibration for attention tracking.
<br>
<br>
Now we will start a short practice (there is no calibration dot for practice).
